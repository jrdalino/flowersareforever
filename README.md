# Workshop: Pricing Algorithm Problem

## Workshop 1:
- During different seasons, the company may decide to vary the pricing schemes for its products. 
- For example, a month before Motherâ€™s Day, the prices of Flowers are marked-up. 
- Different policies may be applied at different times of the year. 
- Flexibility is required, so that different pricing schemes can be selected by the application easily without making many modifications to the existing code.

## Solution:
- Strategy Pattern offers a solution so that switching between the different pricing schemes is simplified. 
- Furthermore, the computation of the price itself is encapsulated in a separate class, so that changes in pricing scheme can be easily made.
